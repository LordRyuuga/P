# Pokémon Polished Custom

This is a custom version of Pokémon Polished Crystal (https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal)

Changes to the original include, but are not limited to:

* Changed up some shops to allow purchase of previously-unique or hard-to-get items.
* Added extra Pokémon to the wild encounter tables of various areas (no more forced breeding to get extra starters, etc.)
* Halved the price of Game Corner Coins.
* Added the "Elite Faux" (thanks Big Red on discord for the name idea!) to Indigo Plateau - a set of super tough trainers that give an optional extra challenge to your playthrough.

The best part is it's compatible with your current Polished Crystal saves!

## How to Play

Simply pick one of the released ROMs (https://github.com/katedering/polished_custom/releases) and have fun!
