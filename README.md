# Pokémon Polished Custom

This is a custom Pokémon game based on [the Pokémon Crystal disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal) as well as Pokémon Polished Crystal, the romhack by [Rangi42](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal).

It's original goal was to create what the title says: an improved, polished version of Pokémon Crystal. It fixes bugs, takes into account the official game changes since 2001, and adds some new ideas of my own. Many features restore what was removed from R/B/Y, or original to HG/SS.

This romhack's goal is to expand on that, as well as add some personal touches to one of my favorite games. Expect an expanded availability of wild Pokémon, shop changes, new trainers, and more!
